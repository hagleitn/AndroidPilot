*Welcome to the Android Pilot project*

The goal of this project is to turn your phone into a autopilot that can fully control a quadcopter. 

You'll need:

* An android phone
* A Gaui 330x
* A IOIO board
* A ping ultrasound sensor

To get started compiling the software:

* Check out the project in Eclipse
* Add android-logging-log4j-1.0.2.jar (will go away soon), log4j-1.2.16.jar to your classpath
* Check out: https://github.com/hagleitn/ioio and link your android project to use it as the IOIO lib

See here for more details on the IOIO: https://github.com/ytai/ioio

Enjoy!
